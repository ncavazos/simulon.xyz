		<h1>Oscillators</h1>
		<p>Oscillators are incredibly powerful tools by themselves. Multing, diffing and other compositing methods get crazy results, especially when you add color to the patch.</p>
		<p>Oscillators can be used for so many things but some ideas to get started when thinking about how to use oscillators:
		<li>
			<ul>Use high frequency oscillators for "scanlines" (works really nicely with ambient patches)</ul>
			<ul>Create abstract and repeatable shapes in a way that is quite different than you would use the normal shape function</ul>
		</li>
		<h2>"Complex" Oscillators</h2>
		<p>In audio synthesis the key to generating interesting sounds is by taking complex soundwave forms and using those to create music. The very same thing can be said of video synthesis, both analog and digital. You can get complex oscillators by a variety of different methods. You can either build up a complex pattern underneath a set of "masking" oscillators and then mult the final output with your oscillators:</p>
